# Day 1 - C Programming ðŸš€

This repo contains my C programming practice from Day 1.  
Each file demonstrates a basic concept of C.

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- hello.c â†’ Prints "Hello, World!"
- sum.c â†’ Takes two numbers as input and prints their sum
- evenodd.c â†’ Checks if a number is even or odd

## ðŸ›  How to Run
1. Compile the code:
   
   gcc filename.c -o output
